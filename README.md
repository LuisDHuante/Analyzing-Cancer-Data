## Affiliation
Final project for the Unsupervised Learning class at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), ENES Morelia Campus, as part of the Bachelorâ€™s in Data Science program.

## Introduction
In the retail sector, understanding consumer behavior is crucial for designing effective marketing strategies. This project explores the application of unsupervised learning techniques to segment consumer behavior and enhance marketing decision-making. By analyzing a dataset that includes various metrics on consumer purchasing behaviors and preferences, the goal is to identify patterns and segment customers into meaningful groups.

## Project
The analysis revealed two main segments of consumers with notable differences in their purchasing behaviors and responses to marketing campaigns. The first segment consists of high-income consumers who prefer luxury products and tend to shop in physical stores and through catalogs. The second segment comprises lower-income consumers who are more inclined to make discount-driven purchases and frequently visit the website. These findings illustrate how unsupervised learning can assist in designing more targeted and effective marketing strategies tailored to the specific needs and behaviors of each segment.

## Documentation
The complete project is available in the .pdf file of this repository, as well as in the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file, which contains all the source code.
